# Django-blog
## About the project
I plan to develop a fully functional Blog Post Management system.
This is the basic structure of the Django based Web-app. It includes a variety of views linked with their respective URLs.
It also has a template containing images and a static blog. Further, I have derived the data dynamically.

## How to run
This includes running the command "python3 manage.py runserver". This creates a local server accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ through which we can see the created website.
